  <p class="w3-xlarge">In San Diego there is an estimated 591,700 dog owners, and in the U.S. 89.7 million people own dogs. Many people register their dog as an emotional support animal so they can be allowed entry into the same places as their human counter parts. Yet many people would prefer to avoid the stigma of pushing their will on businesses that hold a no pet policy. In San Diego there are 6,284 restaurants and only 527 are dog friendly. To help all who’s day is better spent with their canine companion we created Retriever. 
  Retriever makes finding dog friendly businesses easy. </p>

	  <h5 class="w3-padding-30">Our goal for the project was to make a comprehensive source for all dog concerns. The dog Google if you will. Additionally we thought that creating the application as if it were being viewed from the dogs perspective would grab the user’s attention and make the site stand out.

	  <h5>Oh yeah, and in two weeks</h5>

		<h5>1. Make finding dog friendly businesses easy</h5>
		<h5 class="w3-padding-32">2. Create a platform for dog lovers</h5>

      <h4 class="w3-padding-32">EARLY INSIGHTS</h4>
	  <h5>Everyone involved with Retriever was a proud dog parent and saw the value of having a single source for all things dog related</h5>
	  <h5>The combination of having only two weeks to build the application and an aggressive scope created an intense environment with many coordination and time challenges. Engineering estimates drove the design and more robust features were left out due to the time constraints. 
	  <h5>We decided to build in a blog post component with user sign in identification instead of building out an entire social networking component similar to Facebook. 
	  <h5>Knowing that women account for 85% of all consumer purchases, we trusted that the research we were able to gather amongst ourselves, an all women team, was enough to support the viabilty of Retriever.</h5>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Keeping with the “dogs eye view” theme we decided to display each menu item with an icon large enough for a paw to select on the landing page.</h5> 

	  <h5>Once the menu item is selected it takes you to the corresponding search page where a list of options are populated based on your current location. If you are looking for businesses in another location there is a search bar where you can type in your desired location. </h5>
	  <h5>There is a forum where people can keep each other informed of any dog happenings in their community</h5>

      <h1>REFLECTION</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"> Having an app that walks the user through from a dog’s perspective though novel and fun can also be distracting when your goal is to simply find somewhere to go.</h5>
      <h5>Once the user selects their desired business from the home page they are brought to a familiar search page framework. This design decision made the most sense especially with consideration to how much time we had to complete the application.</h5>
      <h5>At the beginning of the project we envisioned a visually rich and animated application.</h5>
      <h5>Retriever does what we set it out to do, much like any retriever would. You can search for any dog friendly business and find them listed before you.</h5>
